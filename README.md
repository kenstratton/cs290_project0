## ▼ 5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike

### 1. GitHub 
https://github.com/

I like the GitHub website at the points of its simple layout and functionality that is eraborated to support programing and documentation.<br>
One complaint from me is that some documents or files can not be open on the ios version.

\* Re-review<br>
I noticed the website's good aspects more by learning in CS290.<br>
For example, the GitHub site is good at navigating users for what they want to reach.<br>
The navigation ability is due to breadcrumbs, site maps on the sidebar, and variety of annotations which are displayed by hovering a cursor on icons.



### 2. Max Korzh

Behaviors of a mouse when clicked and hovered is quite attractive, showing the creater's great sense in design.<br>
I feel font size of menu items are a bit small, so it could be bigger.

\* Re-review<br>
I noticed the site's responsive design is so good that unique behaviors of design are maintained while organaizing website components to see easy.<br>
And I found a new proglem that the audio progress bar becomes inactive when the audio reaches the middle.<br>
The cause of the matter attributes to maybe JavaScript which does a role of its audio player.



### 3. Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

I like that it supports a large number of diferrent languages and organizes a lot of sentence simplly. Also, content locations in a tab are well positioned when shrinked. <br>
I hope visualization of password is implemented in inputing on a login or register page.

\* Re-review<br>
The sitemaps on the sidebar, word description with pictures displayed by focusing on a particular word, and header/footer menus help users to navigate.<br>
Also validations on login/create-account work properly.<br>
One UI problem I noticed is that when web site tab is shrined, texts become not easy to see due to the narrowing width of the text block.<br>
That would be solved if its possible to change arrangement of the site contents or set minimum width at a level where contents remain easy to see.



### 4. Lusion

It feels really creative that the display design significantly changes along with scrolling.<br>
When zoomed out or scrolling rapidly, the website becomes laggy. I don't know how to improve this because I'm not familiar with the implemetation technique.

\* Re-review<br>
The responsive design arranging site contents is good, but the close button of menu list is out of the menu modal at a particular and difficult to find.(UI problem)<br>
And texts of contact information and social media information are too small to see without closing a face to the screen (navigation problem).<br>
The both UI and navigation problems would be improved by editing css. (modal width and text size)



### 5. Mercedes Benz
https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/

Most of the pages firstly show a big and cool car picture followed by small images with some explanations, which is easy to see.<br>
A negative aspect of the website is that its header bar slides a little when any page is accessed. This would be improved by reviewing the CSS.

\* Re-review<br>
Navigation contents are well-equipped (site maps on header/footer/drop-down menus).<br>
When shrinked the Articles/News/Videos section becomes one raw display of content lineup from two rows which looks good responsive design.<br>
Moreover, the shrinking page switch its side menu to footer menu which seems kind for users.



### Review My Own Website (for the implemented area)
https://github.com/kenstratton/cs290_project1

The website design is almost completed, and I believe it can respond users's behaviors thanks to setting flex width.<br>
The point I don't like on the website are low navigation quality.<br>
The website displays some icons on the left-side menu, but newly-registered users could not understand its function only with the icons.<br>
I would like to make the icons show some description when hoverd or below them.

▼ Aspects from 5 website reviews I would like to add to my website<br>
・Capcha for login/signup<br>
・Rearrangement of website content locations to more respond to users' behaviors<br>
