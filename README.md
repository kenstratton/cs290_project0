## â–¼ 5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike
### 1. GitHub 
https://github.com/

I like the GitHub website at the points of its simple layout and functionality that is eraborated to support programing and documentation.<br>
One complaint from me is that some documents or files can not be open on the ios version.

### 2. Max Korzh
https://maxkorzh.live/en/

Behaviors of a mouse when clicked and hovered is quite attractive, showing the creater's great sense in design.<br>
I feel font size of menu items are a bit small, so it could be bigger.

### 3. Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

I like that it supports a large number of diferrent languages and organizes a lot of sentence simplly. Also, content locations in a tab are well positioned when shrinked. <br>
I hope visualization of password is implemented in inputing on a login or register page.

### 4. Lusion
https://lusion.co/work

It feels really creative that the display design significantly changes along with scrolling.<br>
When zoomed out or scrolling rapidly, the website becomes laggy. I don't know how to improve this because I'm not familiar with the implemetation technique.

### 5. Mercedes Benz
https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/

Most of the pages firstly show a big and cool car picture followed by small images with some explanations, which is easy to see.<br>
A negative aspect of the website is that its header bar slides a little when any page is accessed. This would be improved by reviewing the CSS.
